# LIRI-Assignment

The purpose of the LIRI assignment was to practice using Node.js and to understand how to use the command line to execute functions and do multiple operations at once. It was our first assignment which required the use of packages (axios, to do API calls). It also required the use of "dotenv". Part of the challenge of the assignment was that it did not give "IKEA-like" instructions. It required us to research and look up what "dotenv" did, now to install it, and the significance of using something like "dotenv" to protect our API keys and other sensitive information which will be required for future assignments and projects.

The three main commands you could use with LIRI was to search for a song on Spotify, find future concert dates and venues for artists via Bandsintown, and to scan the OMDB database whenever we searched for a movie. The fourth functionality was to test and see if LIRI was able to search an external document and be able to import a command to run. These four commands was done by binding the "commands" as a variable into process.argv[2], then using IF's and ELSE IF's statements to execute each commands functions.
